		<h3 class="cb">Creme Brulee</h3>
		
		<p class="des-cb">Creme Brulee is very easy to make and it is one of my favorite dessert. It only needs eggs, milk, sugar, and vanilla extract which can easily get them. One important thing that must be done before putting it into the oven is using a mesh strainer to strain the batter so that the texture will be smooth. This only takes about one hour to make. I highly recommend making this!</p>

		<h3 class="cb">Fruit Tart</h3>
		<p class="des-ft">It takes a few hours to make fruit tarts but it definitely worth the time. You can put any fruit that you like to decorate the tart. Before putting fruits on top of the tart, I added a layer of chocolate and custard cream in order to add more flavor. It is really fun to make it with friends and spend the afternoon together. It is delicious and I love the recipe.</p>

		<h3 class="cb">Banana Bread</h3>
		<p class=des-bb>Banana bread is a dessert that I make most frequently. It is suitable for beginners who just started making desserts. There are so many recipes online and most of them are easy to follow. I like to add chocolate chips and/or chopped nuts to add more texture to it. You can also put anything you want such as raisin, cinneamon, and dried fruit. Give it a try!</p>

	<div>
		<p class="intro">I also like to make cookies, cakes, and Tiramisu. Sometimes, I would make my own recipe and figure out the flavor that I like by adding more ingredients for different texture and tastes. It is relaxing to make desserts no matter whether I am making it alone or with friends. That is so much fun!</p>
