		<p>I am Hayley, a senior undergraduate majoring in Economics at the University of Wisconsin Madison. I am passionate in working with numbers, graphs, and data. I am a self-motivated, detail-oriented, and easygoing person. My career goal is to become a data analyst or working in the finance field.</p>

		<p>I am from Hong Kong and currently staying in Madison, Wisconsin. There is huge differences between two places, I love living in both locations. I was born in Hong Kong and I have spent my entire childhood there. I love spending my day in Mong Kok and Causeway Bay during holiday.</p>

		<p>Making desserts and listening to music are two of my favorite hobbies. I also love traveling and Taiwan is my favorite place because I enjoy their food. This picture is taken in Taiwan and I had an amazing experience visiting there. It is fun to explore their culture and I would love to visit again.</p>
